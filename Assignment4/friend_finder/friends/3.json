	"bio": "Clark is coarse, witty and cautious. This isn't surprising considering for someone with his disturbing past. He was born and grew up in a middle class family in an average town, he lived free of trouble until he was about 4 years old, but at that point everything changed. He lost his father in a robbery gone wrong and was arrested. With the help of a suspicious stranger he had to survive in a corrupt world. But with his skills and strength, he managed to face all obstacles and conquer all fears and doubts. This has turned him into the man he is today. Still plagued by the past, he now works buying a house. By doing so, he hopes to find answers to the events of the past and finally find happiness he has never had."
