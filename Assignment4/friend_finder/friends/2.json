	"bio": "Tom is curious, analytical, honest and perhaps a little too bossy. But there's more than meets the eye, not surprising for somebody with his position. He was born in an average family in a developed town. He lived happily until he was about 16 years old, but at that point life began to change. He got a new pet and was competing in large tournaments. With plenty of money and connections, he is going on a journey in a outlandish world. But with his determination and compassion, there's nothing to stop him from reaching full potential. He could quickly become somebody who could change the world. But there may be more to it than this; he is currently exploring everything. He feels like there's more to discover in this world. Luckily he has plenty of resources to support him."
