	"bio": "Jane is light-hearted, driven, polite and perhaps a little too pompous. But there's more than this to somebody with her position. She was born in a decent family in a wealthy capital. She lived free of worries until she was about 10 years old, but at that point life changed. She explored the country and was learning a new language. With the support of great friends, she is going on a journey in a amazing world. But with her skills and powers, there's nothing to stop her from fulfilling all dreams. She could quickly become an unstoppable force. But anything could happen; she is currently travelling the world. She feels like there's more incredible sights to behold in this world. Luckily she has great companions to support her."
